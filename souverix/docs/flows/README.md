# IMS Component Flow Diagrams

This directory contains flow diagrams for each Souverix component, showing how they interact with other IMS elements in various scenarios.

## Component Flows

- [BGCF Flows](./bgcf-flows.md) - Breakout Gateway Control Function flows
- [P-CSCF Flows](./pcscf-flows.md) - Proxy Call Session Control Function flows
- [I-CSCF Flows](./icscf-flows.md) - Interrogating Call Session Control Function flows
- [S-CSCF Flows](./scscf-flows.md) - Serving Call Session Control Function flows
- [MGCF Flows](./mgcf-flows.md) - Media Gateway Control Function flows
- [HSS Flows](./hss-flows.md) - Home Subscriber Server flows
- *More component flows to be added...*

## Flow Categories

Each component's flow documentation includes:

1. **Primary Flows** - Standard operational scenarios
2. **Breakout Scenarios** - Local and remote breakout handling
3. **Dialog Continuity** - Mid-dialog signaling and state management
4. **Inter-Domain Flows** - Cross-network interactions

## Diagram Format

All flows are documented using Mermaid sequence diagrams for consistency and clarity. Each diagram shows the component's perspective and interactions with other IMS elements.
